# Vulnerability Report
## SQL Injection 
Exposure
SQL Injection is when a user is able to enter SQL queries into a forum and have them execute unwanted queries into your database. SQL injections would have a number of effects on our website. For example, the client could destroy data, retrieve sentitve data (customer information), alter data (over discounting, inventory).
Repair 
The entity framework provides protection against SQL injections because it does not use SQL queries
```
public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
public DbSet<ShoppingCartItem> ShoppingCartItem { get; set; }
```

## Broken Authentication and Session Management 
Exposure 
Broken Authentication and Session Management users with their own accounts, who may attempt to steal accounts from others.
Repair
Using ASP.net Core Identity
```
services.AddIdentity<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole>(options =>
            {
                options.Password.RequiredLength = 3;
                options.Password.RequireLowercase = true;
            })
                .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDBContext>()
                .AddDefaultTokenProviders();

            
```

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
Exposure
Cross site scripting (XSS) is a common attack vector that injects malicious code into a vulnerable web application. Similar to SQL injections they inject unwanted queries however, the target is not the application but the users that are using the web application. 
Repair
the redirect and navigations is handled by the controller on .net core mvc model. anchor tags are also routed to the controller so it isnt even exposed to the consumer.
```
<a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="index">P.U.K</a>
RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
```

## Broken Access Control 
Exposure
A basic method of exploiting access control flaws in an application's code is known as forced browsing.
Repair
the authorize attribute tag on top on the controller will only allow users that have been authorised by .net core identity. if user is not authoried then user will get redircted to the login page.
```
[Authorize]
    public class ShoppingCartController : Controller
```
